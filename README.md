# Modified-Booths-Multiplier-Implementation
This implementation of the Modified Booth's Algorithm multiplies two 2's complement numbers, outputting both the final binary product and the corresponding BCD display for a 7-segment display. It efficiently handles signed multiplication and converts the result for visual representation on hardware. It includes Verilog code, testbenches, and simulation results using Xilinx Vivado. Ideal for FPGA/ASIC designs, DSP, and computer arithmetic circuits.ðŸš€
